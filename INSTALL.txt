Installation
==--------==
Requirements:
 GNU Make, preferrably v3.81
    CFDbuilder requires GNU make (https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    to build. It may work with other make systems, but it has been
    tested with GNU Make 3.81.

After gmake is installed,
1) Download the following libraries and place them in the "lib" folder:
       antlr-3.3-complete.jar
       appFramework-1.0.jar
       jnlp.jar
2) cd src
3) make package

cfdbuilder.jar will be built and placed at the top level directory (one
directory above source).

Usage
==-==
Requirements:
  Intel Fortran Compiler or GNU Fortran compiler
    You need a Fortran compiler to actually use CFDbuilder. It has not
  been tested with other Fortran compilers, and at the moment, it has 
  been hard-coded to look for either the Intel compiler or the GNU 
  compiler. 

You can run it on any input source file,
   cd ../input
   java -jar ../cfdbuilder.jar -pipeline <sourcefile.F>

The optimized output will be called output_pipelined.f.

During development you do not have to generate a new package (jar)
everytime. You can rebuild and run using,
   cd src
   make
   cd ../input
   java -cp ../bin;../lib/antlr-3.3-complete.jar translator.Translator -pipeline <sourcefile.F>
